# **===Quant Equity Settings===**

Repo that consists of all settings used for Quant Equity software modules

# **Usage**

After connecting to the [Quant Equity Artifact Feed](https://robeco.visualstudio.com/Quant%20Research/_wiki/wikis/Quant-Research.wiki/742/Startup-guide?anchor=**setting-up-artifact-feed**),
you can install Quant Equity Settings by running the pip command:

```cmd
    pip install qe_settings
```

About the package ``requirements``:

- Install the dev requirements in your local machine by running:

```cmd
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

# Git branching guidelines
The master branch is the main working branch for researchers.

If you want to push your branch please adhere to the following rules:
* If you add a new feature to the repo, use: "**feature**/<branch_name>".
* For bugfixes, use: "**bugfix**/<branch_name>".
* For research projects, use: "**research**/<branch_name>".
* For expansion of our unittests, use: "**tests**/<branch_name>".

Besides, delete your branch after merge or inactivity. We want to keep the repo clean!

# Contributing to Quant Equity Settings
We adhere to strong coding quality.
Please read the following [documentation](https://robeco.visualstudio.com/Quant%20Research/_wiki/wikis/Quant-Research.wiki/1577/Code-Quality-Policy)
before contributing.

If you want to make a PR, please format your code following *Pre-Commit* rules.
The rules are specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
In order to check whether your code complies you can first install pre-commit:
```
pip install pre-commit
```

You can then run the following command to check whether the code is compliant:
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If you want you can run pre-commit automatically whenever you want to commit and avoid commits if
the code does not pass the tests. To set this up run the following command in your terminal:
```
pre-commit install
```

Finally, you should make sure that our *unittests* cover the added features.
That is, you might need to add test functions. These are ALL located in the `tests` folder.
Make sure that all tests succeed by running the following lines in your folder with the `.git` file:

```cmd
pytest
```

# Security protocol for Rhino settings
For all strategies, both with research and with production settings, we test whether the required data and ranking outcomes change.
We do this by keeping track of the hashes of the data-input and the final ranking. These hashes are saved in the `tests/test_ranking/test_integration` folder and look like:

![hash example](docs/source/_static/SecurityHashes.png)

You can update the hashes using the following command in your command line from your qe_settings `.git` location:
```
rhino-updatehash
```

Whenever you want to add a new `node`/`transformer`/`combinator` to the `models_prd.yml`,
you also need to add a description of the object in the `descriptions.yml`.
Be sure that the object you describe is in the same place relative
to the other objects as in the `models_prd.yml`.
Otherwise, the unit test will fail.

In addition, to be able to preserve historical mappings whenever there are name changes, we use `rhino_id`s.
Every object in `models_prd.yml` should also have a mapping in the `rhino_id_mapping.yml`.
If you make new objects, the identifiers will be updated automatically when you run `rhino-updatehash`.
However, if you want to rename a node/transformer/combinator you should specifically run one of
the following commands in the command line:
```cmd
rhino-id --rename-node <old_name> <new_name>
rhino-id --rename-transformer <old_name> <new_name>
rhino-id --rename-combinator <old_name> <new_name>
```

# Updating Asterix settings
Asterix settings are also checked using hashes. After making changes you will need to update hashes by running the following command in your command line from your qe_settings `.git` location:
```
asterix-updatehash
```
